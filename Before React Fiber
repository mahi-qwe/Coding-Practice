// JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE NOTE:

Before Fiber: React 15 and below
React used a recursive, synchronous rendering algorithm:

It rendered components from top to bottom in one go.

Big trees = blocking the main thread.

You couldnâ€™t pause in the middle of rendering.

No control over which parts to prioritize.

Result: slow, laggy UI, especially on large apps or low-end devices.
